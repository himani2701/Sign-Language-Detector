Sign-Language-Detector
Project Overview
The Sign Language Detector is an innovative, real-time application designed to bridge communication gaps by recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures. Leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide a responsive and intuitive tool for understanding and interacting with sign language, facilitating greater accessibility and inclusion.

Features
Real-time Detection: Utilizes live video feed (e.g., webcam) to instantly detect and interpret sign language gestures.

Machine Learning Powered: Employs a robust machine learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) trained on a diverse dataset of signs for high accuracy.

Intuitive User Interface: A user-friendly web-based interface for easy interaction and display of detected signs.

Scalable Architecture: Designed with modular components, allowing for easy expansion to include more signs or different sign languages in the future.

Open-Source: Built with open-source technologies, encouraging community contributions and further development.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the application logic and machine learning backend.

Flask: A lightweight web framework used for serving the application.

OpenCV: For real-time video capture, processing, and image manipulation.

TensorFlow / Keras: For building, training, and deploying the machine learning models.

Mediapipe: (Optional, but often used for robust hand and pose landmark detection if implemented) For enhanced sign recognition accuracy.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For the frontend user experience.
